1. In step 4, we are sending a payload which fills buffer with A, BBBB in EIP and an array of 256 badchars (00-FF) in the stack (ESP points towards this)

2. On the debug machine, we can generate a file which contains the same list of badchars with the help of python:
   badchar_test = ""
   badchars = [0x00, 0x0A, 0xAD]
   for i in range(0x00, 0xFF+1):
   	  if i not in badchars:
        badchar_test += chr(i)
   with open("badchar_test.bin", "wb") as f:
      f.write(badchar_test)

3. Now, we can compare the contents of stack pointed by esp and the file using mona module:
   !mona compare -a esp -f C:\Python27\badchar_test.bin

This gives us the list of badchars to avoid.
